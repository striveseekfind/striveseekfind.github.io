<p>Hi there. You've reached the personal site of John S. Bissonette, otherwise known as <a href="https://github.com/striveseekfind" class="user-mention">@striveseekfind</a>. I am an IT professional, with experience in network/systems administration as well as data center operations. I am also a budding web developer, with an interest in full-stack development in ASP.NET and JavaScript, though not at all limited to these technologies. I am a lifelong learner, with a passion for technology, science, and current events. I also am a United States Marine, having served in the US Marine Corps from 2005 - 2010.</p>

<a id="marine-corps" class="anchor" href="#marine-corps" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Marine Corps</h3>

<p>I began my professional career in IT when I enlisted in the Marine Corps in 2005. At the time I chose my job, I elected to be trained as an <strong><em>Aviation Electronics Technician</em></strong>. This was a broad occupational field, though at the time I was simply told "you'll get to work on jets." I love airplanes, and have been fascinated by them my entire life, so the thought of working on F/A-18's or A/V-8B's piqued my interest immediately. However, after graduating boot camp from MCRD Parris Island, SC in 2005 and subsequently attending Marine Combat Training (MCT) aboard Camp Geiger, part of the larger MCB Camp Lejeune complex in NC, I found out the specific military occupational specialty (MOS) that I was assigned to: 6694 - Aviation Logistics Information Management System Specialist. This long-winded term boils down to Geek Squad for the Marine Air Wing. Needless to say, at first I was disappointed.</p>

<p>It wasn't long before I realized how valuable the job training I was receiving would be in the long run, and not much longer after that before I realized that what I was being trained for was in fact really, really cool. My job school, known in the Marines as <em>A-School</em>, was located in Athens, GA. There was a tiny base there, located at the intersection of Prince Ave and Oglethorpe Ave called Naval Support Activity (NSA) Athens, GA. Not far from the main University of Georgia campus, it provided an awesome atmosphere to learn and to experience the vibrant collegiate atmosphere of an SEC institution. The school was intense and long. After about 10 months, I graduated with orders to MALS-14 AISD, MAG-14, 2nd MAW, at MCAS Cherry Point, NC.</p>

<p>Arriving at Cherry Point, I was assigned to the Aviation Information Systems Department of MALS-14, in the Network Administration Division. My primary responsibilities entailed maintaining the tactical network on the MALS-14 van pads, preventative maintenance of the network equipment and infrastructure, and to analyze, troubleshoot, and fix any issues with the network infrastructure. It was awesome, because we got to use some really sweet tools and the experience was excellent for someone without the formal education provided by a college degree. Probably the coolest things I got to use was an OTDR, or optical time-domain reflectometer, used to test fiber-optic network cabling and a fusion splicer for fiber. The fusion splicer is used to fix breaks in fiber-optic cabling that would be more costly to rerun, as fiber is expensive.</p>

<p>Throughout the majority of my time in the Marines, I was a network administrator. However, when I deployed to Iraq with VMA-542, I was assigned to MALS-29 (REIN) and also held duties in other divisions of AISD including Maintenance Support Division and Customer Service Division. On my second deployment with VMA-231, I was HMM-264 (REIN) S-6. Myself and another Marine from my MOS were the sole Marines responsible for all of -264's IT infrastructure. It was during this deployment that I performed the bulk of my systems administrator duties. One of the best experiences I have had in the military came from this deployment. I was the first Marine in my MOS to deploy in support of the Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS), first and foremost responsible for the JMPS suite that the Harriers of VMA-231 employed.</p>

<p>The JMPS suite is a hardware/software suite that is utilized by pilots when planning their missions. Every aspect of the mission is planned meticulously and then loaded onboard the aircraft for their flight. This was a unique challenge for me as the training syllabus really only taught me how to install the product. There was no training on common issues encountered, troubleshooting, and very rudimentary instructions on whom to contact for escalation of issues. The engineers at the JMPS Program Office at NAVAIR PMA-281 were incredibly helpful though, and assisted me immensely when I needed help - even at 5 AM EST when I was 7,000 miles away and calling for immediate assistance with a problem. Near the end of my deployment, I authored an After-Action Report for the JMPS Officer-in-Charge, a Harrier pilot whom I reported to. My report detailed every issue that I encountered with the system, its integration aboard the amphibious assault vessel upon which we embarked for the deployment, and other issues using the system. The report made its way to Lockheed Martin's Chief Engineer for the A/V-8B and C-130J/K platforms, and the Commanding Officer of VMX-31, the Marine Corps' test squadron, a Colonel. I received an email from both that was forwarded to me that stated: "Bravo Zulu to LCpl Bissonette and Capt. (name omitted for privacy's sake) for the report and identifying systemic issues integrating JMPS aboard ship." I was most proud to have contributed to the betterment of Marine Corps combat aviation with this report and for the work I performed with the Ace of Spades, Marine Attack Squadron 231.</p>

<p>I was slated to go on a third deployment, this time to Afghanistan with VMAQ-3, a Marine Corps EA-6B Prowler electronic warfare squadron at the beginning of 2010. I had an extension of my contract in work and had completed the bulk of my pre-deployment training before I received word that the deployment had been moved past my end of active service date, or EAS. This meant that in order for me to deploy, I was no longer eligible to extend my contract and instead had to elect to reenlist. I refused reenlistment, and chose to discharge from the Marine Corps when my EAS came about. Thus, an anticlimactic end to an otherwise awesome career in the Marines.</p>

<p>After graduating from Monroe Community College in 2014, I was planning to move back to Rhode Island and continue my education by enrolling in the clinical portion of a Bachelor's of Science in Nursing. Obtaining my BSN was my goal for the previous two years, and while at MCC I completed all of the academic prerequisites for a clinical BSN program at a four-year university. However, I was unable to move, and it being too late to transfer to a local college for their BSN program I needed a job, and I needed it yesterday. I had no experience in the medical field, and many of the jobs in the medical field including LPN, CNA, and such, require certification or licensure. Lacking any of these credentials, the only thing left on my resume was my IT experience in the Marines. I applied to several positions and posted my resume online. I received a call from a technical recruiter shortly after posting from a company called TEKsystems.</p>

<p>TEKsystems is a contracting company for IT staffing, and they had a contract for an Operations Analyst at the University of Rochester, University IT, Enterprise Data Centers. TEKsystems noticed on my resume that I had experience in the military working  with <a href="http://www.solarwinds.com/">SolarWinds</a>, a network monitoring tool. I mentioned it once, and it caught their eye. I met with two of the TEKsystems recruiters, and had an excellent interview that went very well with them, and they arranged for me to interview with the Data Center Manager at the University of Rochester. That interview went well and I was offered the position. I accepted immediately. Since then, my contract with TEKsystems was converted and I became a University of Rochester employee continuing in my then-current position. Eventually, I was promoted to Enterprise Computing Operations Senior Analyst. My job involves maintaining an overview of all the resident systems in the data centers, both physical, virtual, the storage-area network, and all LAN/WAN links for the University and the Medical Center. We utilize multiple monitoring tools and keep track of all maintenance being performed, file transfers, backups, and system and environmental health. We also monitor physical security of our data centers as well. Although we are not directly responsible for monitoring, we also keep an eye on the University's IBM BlueGene/Q and BlueHive high-performance computing cluster used for research.</p>

<a id="education" class="anchor" href="#education" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Education</h2>

<p>After leaving the Marines, I attended the <a href="http://www.rit.edu/">Rochester Institute of Technology</a> to study IT. My heart was wholly involved with my studies, and I ended up leaving the Institution shortly after changing majors to Journalism. After waiting out the next semester, I transferred to <a href="http://www.monroecc.edu/">Monroe Community College</a> and my major was Liberal Arts, Health Related. It was at MCC that I found a passion for studying science, and my goal was to complete my AS degree and transfer to a clinical program for BSN. However, after completing my degree I was unable to transfer and have now refocused my personal and professional goals towards attaining a B.Sc. in Data Science from the University of Rochester.</p>
